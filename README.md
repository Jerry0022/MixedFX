# MixedFX

## To Use:
Please find packages under build/distributions.
Please unpack the file and add the contained jars to your build path.

## To Build with Eclipse:
May change version in preBuild.gradle and build.gradle (should be the same version)
May delete old build folder.
Run build.gradle as "gradle build Gradle build"
-> If this does not work: Use cmd in the project folder and execute "gradle -b preBuild.gradle build" (+same with build.gradle)
